<h1>Active Directory - Group Policy Management: Welcome Message</h1>

This tutorial walks through configuring a custom welcome message that appears at user login, using **Group Policy Management within an Active Directory domain environment**. You'll learn how to centrally manage this setting via a Group Policy Object (GPO) applied through Active Directory.<br />


<h2>Why Use a Login Welcome Message?</h2>
Displaying a custom message at login is a simple but powerful way to share important information with users before they access their desktops. Organizations commonly use these messages for:

- Legal disclaimers and compliance notices

- Company policies or security warnings

- General announcements or support contact info

- By configuring this through Group Policy, you can ensure consistent messaging across all domain-joined computers.

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Active Directory

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>
